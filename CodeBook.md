Subject
The experiments have been carried out with a group of 30 volunteers within an age bracket of 19-48 years. Each subject is represented by a unique number between 1 and 30.

ActivityDescription
AcitivityDesciprion lists the name of the activity performed by the subject and can have possible values as [WALKING, WALKING_UPSTAIRS, WALKING_DOWNSTAIRS, SITTING, STANDING, LAYING]

The various measurements have been obtained using the accelerometer and gyroscope on the Samsung Galaxy SII, present on the waist of each subject.
The various measurements obtained can be broadly classified into two categories viz. Time Domain Signals & Frequency Domain signals.

Time domain Signals
The following measurements represent mean and standard deviations of the body acceleration signals in the X,Y & Z axes as measured by the accelerometer.

tBodyAccmeanX
